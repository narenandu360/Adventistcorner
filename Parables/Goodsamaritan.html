        <p>Jesus told the story of a man who was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho. On his way, he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him, and went away, leaving him half-dead.</p>
        <p>A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</p>
        <p>But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</p>
        <p>The next day, he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'</p>

        <p>"Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?"</p>
        <p>The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him."</p>
        <p>Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."</p>
